## Usage

Once configured, the extension will automatically display song statistics in the right nav. The stats update automatically when you change songs.

## Configuration options

The extension stores your settings locally in your browser:
- **Last.fm API key**: Required for fetching play counts
- **Last.fm username**: Required for personal statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Stats show "?" or "Unknown"

- Verify your Last.fm API key and username are correct
- Check that the song exists in your Last.fm library
- Ensure you have scrobbled the track to Last.fm

### Extension not appearing

- Make sure Spicetify is properly installed and applied
- Check that the extension files are in the correct directory
- Try restarting Spotify

### API rate limiting

- The extension respects Last.fm API limits
- If you see temporary "?" values, wait a moment for the next API call

## Privacy

This extension:

- Stores your Last.fm credentials locally in your browser
- Only makes API calls to Last.fm and Spotify's internal APIs
- Does not collect or transmit any personal data elsewhere
